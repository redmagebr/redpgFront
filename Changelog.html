        Following the standard of setting english as the default language for whichever parts will only exist in a single language, RedPG will no longer look for offline sound files in the "Sons" folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        From now on, RedPG will look for offline sounds in the "Sounds" folder. So you need to rename it from "Sons" to "Sounds".
