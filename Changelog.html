	<p>When rolling dice for unloaded style, information about the style will be printed while hovering instead of on the chat.</p>
	<p>Images section now defaults to Upload.</p>
	<p>Fix for Single-Screen Mode: changing focus to the left side will correctly hide the right side, even if the window requested is already up.</p>
	<p>Stream mode should now work. It was supposed to be not working, but no one complained? Was it working even though it shouldn't? Nobody knows. Maybe cache kept it safe.</p>
	<p>Dices should be more compact now, making them go multi-line less often. Dice reasons were also made more compact.</p>

    <p>
        More optimizations to sheet code should allow sheet switches to happen about twice as fast as before, varying with the differences between the sheets being used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sheets with similar sizes will, once again, get switched to faster.

        Changing between Edit/View mode in Sheets and updating sheets should now be <b>considerably</b> faster.
    </p>
    <p>
        Changing between sheets should be somewhat faster. So long as the new sheet has less elements than the current sheet, it should be <b>considerably</b> faster. It should still be somewhat faster if the new sheet is very different.
