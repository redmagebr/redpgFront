    <h1>0.25.4</h1>
    <p>Switched to the unmangled original font files of Alegreya (Whole app) and Caudex (Chat messages). Things may look weird at first, but that is because the font is now showing properly.</p>
</div>

    <h1>0.25.3</h1>
    <p>Right Window minimum size reduced to 720px.</p>
    <p>Left Window will grow first until it is 600px wide.</p>
    <p>Beyond that, Left and Right window will mostly share the remaining space 1:1, however:</p>
    <p>Left Window size will grow beyond 600px in increments of 90px. Meaning that all growths it has will mean a new avatar space in chat.</p>

    <h1>0.24.0</h1>
    <p>Chat will auto-prune older messages when there are too many. This should improve performance of long-lasting rooms on slower hardware.</p>
    <p>Automatic pruning of messages will not happen any time the "Show older messages" button is clicked.</p>
