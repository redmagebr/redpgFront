        If a room is alive (as in, there are people inside a room) the system will now store the last ten messages in a cache.
    </p>
    <p>
        Upon joining a room, these messages will be printed in the chat, giving a little bit of context to the joining user.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is experimental: server load will be closely watched so that a good number of stored messages can be chosen. It is currently set to 10 cached messages.

        Updates to the Sheet System allows styles to be less sub-optimized with regards to multiple fields updating the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Loading a sheet or switching sheets should become somewhat faster now, provided the style utilizes these changes.

        Webms are no longer muted by default! They will use the same Volume as background musics for now.

        It is now possible to use "{" and "}" as markers in Roleplay and Story messages. This will print the text inside as Bold Italic.
