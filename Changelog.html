    <p>Changes how screen real estate is divided amongst both sides.</p>
    <p>Left Window will hog all the space available until resolutions 1356 pixels wide.</p>
    <p>Beyond that, Left Window will grow at least four pixels for every pixel the right window grows.</p>
    <p>Above 1626 pixels wide, Left Window will grow a pixel for every pixel the right window grows.</p>
    <p>After Left Window stops being a space hogger, it will give back every pixel above what it needs to show a new avatar when showing the Chat. This means that the last Avatar shown will always align with the end of the Chat window.</p>
