	<p>When rolling dice for unloaded style, information about the style will be printed while hovering instead of on the chat.</p>
	<p>Images section now defaults to Upload.</p>
	<p>Fix for Single-Screen Mode: changing focus to the left side will correctly hide the right side, even if the window requested is already up.</p>
	<p>Stream mode should now work. It was supposed to be not working, but no one complained? Was it working even though it shouldn't? Nobody knows. Maybe cache kept it safe.</p>
	<p>Dices should be more compact now, making them go multi-line less often. Dice reasons were also made more compact.</p>

	<p>Immensely decreased the amount of files required to load RedPG. RedPG should initially open up extremely faster now.</p>
	<p>This is mostly untested. Please report any bugs.</p>
