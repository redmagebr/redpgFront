        More optimizations to sheet code should allow sheet switches to happen about twice as fast as before, varying with the differences between the sheets being used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sheets with similar sizes will, once again, get switched to faster.

        Changing between Edit/View mode in Sheets and updating sheets should now be <b>considerably</b> faster.
    </p>
    <p>
        Changing between sheets should be somewhat faster. So long as the new sheet has less elements than the current sheet, it should be <b>considerably</b> faster. It should still be somewhat faster if the new sheet is very different.

        It is now possible to upload image files directly to RedPG.

        Fixed: opening logs or full room history should no longer play the last sounds sent and show the last image sent.

        If a room is alive (as in, there are people inside a room) the system will now store the last ten messages in a cache.
    </p>
    <p>
        Upon joining a room, these messages will be printed in the chat, giving a little bit of context to the joining user.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is experimental: server load will be closely watched so that a good number of stored messages can be chosen. It is currently set to 10 cached messages.

        Updates to the Sheet System allows styles to be less sub-optimized with regards to multiple fields updating the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Loading a sheet or switching sheets should become somewhat faster now, provided the style utilizes these changes.

        Webms are no longer muted by default! They will use the same Volume as background musics for now.
    </p>

        Later Webms will get the following personal options: muted, autoplay, loop, volume.

        It is now possible to use "{" and "}" as markers in Roleplay and Story messages. This will print the text inside as Bold Italic.

    <p>
        Text inside { and } will also <b>not be translated</b> in language speak.
