        More optimizations to sheet code should allow sheet switches to happen about twice as fast as before, varying with the differences between the sheets being used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sheets with similar sizes will, once again, get switched to faster.
    </p>

    <p>
        Changing between Edit/View mode in Sheets and updating sheets should now be <b>considerably</b> faster.
    </p>
    <p>
        Changing between sheets should be somewhat faster. So long as the new sheet has less elements than the current sheet, it should be <b>considerably</b> faster. It should still be somewhat faster if the new sheet is very different.

        It is now possible to upload image files directly to RedPG.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fixed: opening logs or full room history should no longer play the last sounds sent and show the last image sent.

        If a room is alive (as in, there are people inside a room) the system will now store the last ten messages in a cache.
    </p>
    <p>
        Upon joining a room, these messages will be printed in the chat, giving a little bit of context to the joining user.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is experimental: server load will be closely watched so that a good number of stored messages can be chosen. It is currently set to 10 cached messages.
    </p>

    <h1>0.52.3</h1>
    <p>
        Updates to the Sheet System allows styles to be less sub-optimized with regards to multiple fields updating the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Loading a sheet or switching sheets should become somewhat faster now, provided the style utilizes these changes.
    </p>

        Webms are no longer muted by default! They will use the same Volume as background musics for now.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later Webms will get the following personal options: muted, autoplay, loop, volume.

        It is now possible to use "{" and "}" as markers in Roleplay and Story messages. This will print the text inside as Bold Italic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Text inside { and } will also <b>not be translated</b> in language speak.
