	<h1>0.56.6</h1>
	<p>Minor updates necessary for the Map sheets.</p>
	<p>Speaking in languages now NEVER prints the translation while streaming, even for GMs.</p>
</div>

<div data-major='0' data-minor='56' data-release='5'>
	<h1>0.56.5</h1>
	<p>Sheets should correctly apply language options to new rows created on lists.</p>
	<p>When entering a room and receiving the last few messages, this will be considered a "First Print", meaning that any sounds, images or videos in those messages will not be printed.</p>
	<p>Changes to Stream vision.</p>
	<p>You can now start streaming through "/stream 0" to hide the avatar container, increasing the size of the ChatBox.</p>
	<p>NEW SETTINGS FOR STREAMERS:</p>
	<p>
		Left Margin: 15 pixels....... Top Margin: 0 pixels......
	</p>
	<p>The Right Window will now use the remaining space to the right, stretching to fit. This should allow streamers to set up some sheets that were meant to be shown that small.</p>

	<h1>0.56.4</h1>
	<p>New size option for picture drawings.</p>
</div>

<div data-major='0' data-minor='56' data-release='3'>
	<h1>0.56.3</h1>
	<p>When printing current effects from the Buff Tracker, each buff will take a line. These messages will have a font somewhat smaller than the others.</p>
	<p>Current conditions will now be printed for ALL players on turn start, rather than just the Storyteller.</p>
	<p>Auto-adding conditions no longer multiplies if the storyteller has multiple windows open.</p>
	<p>Condition prompt for storytellers no longer appears while streaming.</p>
	<p>Some changes to sheets required for the Maps style.</p>
	<p>Sheet List will correctly print language-based style names.</p>
</div>

<div data-major='0' data-minor='56' data-release='2'>
	<h1>0.56.2</h1>
	<p>When rolling dice for unloaded style, information about the style will be printed while hovering instead of on the chat.</p>
	<p>Images section now defaults to Upload.</p>
	<p>Fix for Single-Screen Mode: changing focus to the left side will correctly hide the right side, even if the window requested is already up.</p>
	<p>Stream mode should now work. It was supposed to be not working, but no one complained? Was it working even though it shouldn't? Nobody knows. Maybe cache kept it safe.</p>
	<p>Dices should be more compact now, making them go multi-line less often. Dice reasons were also made more compact.</p>

	<h1>0.56.1</h1>
	<p>Small fix for lists in sheets.</p>
</div>

<div data-major='0' data-minor='56' data-release='0'>
	<h1>0.56.0</h1>
	<p>Immensely decreased the amount of files required to load RedPG. RedPG should initially open up extremely faster now.</p>
	<p>This is mostly untested. Please report any bugs.</p>
