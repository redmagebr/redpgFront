	<h1>0.56.3</h1>
	<p>When printing current effects from the Buff Tracker, each buff will take a line. These messages will have a font somewhat smaller than the others.</p>
	<p>Current conditions will now be printed for ALL players on turn start, rather than just the Storyteller.</p>
	<p>Auto-adding conditions no longer multiplies if the storyteller has multiple windows open.</p>
	<p>Condition prompt for storytellers no longer appears while streaming.</p>
	<p>Some changes to sheets required for the Maps style.</p>
	<p>Sheet List will correctly print language-based style names.</p>
</div>

<div data-major='0' data-minor='56' data-release='2'>
	<h1>0.56.2</h1>
	<p>When rolling dice for unloaded style, information about the style will be printed while hovering instead of on the chat.</p>
	<p>Images section now defaults to Upload.</p>
	<p>Fix for Single-Screen Mode: changing focus to the left side will correctly hide the right side, even if the window requested is already up.</p>
	<p>Stream mode should now work. It was supposed to be not working, but no one complained? Was it working even though it shouldn't? Nobody knows. Maybe cache kept it safe.</p>
	<p>Dices should be more compact now, making them go multi-line less often. Dice reasons were also made more compact.</p>

	<h1>0.56.1</h1>
	<p>Small fix for lists in sheets.</p>
</div>

<div data-major='0' data-minor='56' data-release='0'>
	<h1>0.56.0</h1>
	<p>Immensely decreased the amount of files required to load RedPG. RedPG should initially open up extremely faster now.</p>
	<p>This is mostly untested. Please report any bugs.</p>
