Havlova Austral by Fereydoun Rostam

Based on the calligraphy of czech-australian photographer Sonia Havlova Makac. If you want to know the work of the woman whose calligraphy inspirated the font Havlova, visit her site at www.bohemiansecret.net.au

They used this font in the opening credits of a Brazilian TV Novell called "Amor Ã  Vida". I am not a fan of television novels, but I love to see my work presented with another wonderful animation by the artist Ryan Woodward (ryanwoodwardart.com).

See the animation:
