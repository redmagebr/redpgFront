    <p>Many flaws in the code were fixed.</p>
    <p>Static files were split from dynamic server. So now static files are accessed on a different server and accessing them will never harm the dynamic server's performance.</p>
    <p>This also speeds up development by reducing the size of uploads both ways.</p>
