    <p>Whispers!!!!</p>
    <p>- /whisper (and alias /w) allows one to whisper another player. One can press tab to auto-complete.</p>
    <p>- /reply (and alias /r) allows one to reply to the last player to whisp you. If no one whispered you, it will do nothing.</p>
    <p>---------</p>
    <p>The addition of whispers allow new things. Secret rolls added! Secret rolls are a whisper between you and the Storyteller!</p>
